# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Common Vulnerabilities

Vulnerability #1: Directory Traversal

URL: https://35.184.88.145/blue/
URL: https://35.184.88.145/red/
URL: https://35.184.88.145/green/

REFERENCES:

CWE 548
WASC 48

ANALYSIS:
It is possible to view the directory listing.  Directory listing may reveal hidden scripts, include files, backup source files etc which can be accessed to read sensitive information.

SCREENSHOTS:

INFORMATION EXTRACTED:
Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu) Server at 35.184.88.145 Port 443

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection

URL: https://35.184.88.145/blue/public/salesperson.php?id=7%27%20OR%20SLEEP(5)--%27 

VULNERABILITY:
CWE 89

ANALYSIS:
The page results were successfully manipulated using the boolean conditions [7' AND '1'='1' -- ] and [7' AND '1'='2' -- ]
The parameter value being modified was NOT stripped from the HTML output for the purposes of the comparison
Data was returned for the original parameter.
The vulnerability was detected by successfully restricting the data originally returned, by manipulating the parameter

The vulnerability is confirmed by using [id=7' OR SLEEP(5)=0-- ] will cause the site to wait 5 seconds before loading.
